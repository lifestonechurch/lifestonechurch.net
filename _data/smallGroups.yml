        description: Sam and Rachael Coleman moved from Ft. Worth, Tx in 1999 to help with a small church in Pleasant Grove, UT.  They met through a mutual friend who was Rachael’s youth pastor and Sam’s college friend when Rachael was 15.  A few years later when Rachael was a Sophomore in college the same youth pastor partnered them together for a Disciple Now Weekend (which is an intense weekend long small group for youth).  The reason Sam and Rachael were put together according to the youth pastor was because these two are so different it should be interesting.  After 18 years of marriage, “interesting” is still the word for what Sam and Rachael bring to small groups.  We are excited to be a part of Lifestone Church with our four children Abigail (16), Atticus (14), Asher (8), and Adelai Shalom (7).  We are looking to form life-long friendships and work alongside others in our LifeGroups this year.

        description: Denise and Kelly are both from the Salt Lake City area. They met through a mutual friend while serving with the worship band at their former church. Their son Jeremiah was born in August 2013, and his friendly nature and smiling face brings so much joy to everyone he meets. Kelly works as a forklift driver at Costco, and Denise is a credit analyst for a group of credit unions. Kelly and Denise began attending Lifestone Church in summer 2015, and fell in love with the church’s sense of family, kids programs, and people. Kelly now serves at Lifestone as a guitarist in the worship band and as a youth small group leader/youth music coordinator. Denise serves as a pianist in the worship band, in 1st Impressions, and on the administration team. For fun, Kelly enjoys cycling and hiking, and Denise enjoys cycling and knitting. The couple’s favorite thing about LifeGroups is giving people who are new to the Bible a safe place to explore and ask questions, and they hope that you, too, find a safe, loving group in which to explore the Bible and Jesus’ AWESOME love!

        description: Ben and Kristen Helton met in college in the panhandle of Texas. After graduating they got married and moved to the Dallas area where Ben attended seminary while Kristen taught elementary music. After serving in churches as a Pastor to Students for 12 years, Ben was asked to start a new church in Weatherford, Texas in 2009. After much prayer and research, the Helton's felt called to start a church in Herriman, Utah, where no Bible-based church had been started before. Ben, Kristen, children Rachel (14), Karis (12), and Jaxson (9), and a team of 3 additional families moved from the Fort Worth area to Herriman in August of 2013 start Lifestone Church. Growing this new church and connecting with new neighbors and friends here in Utah has been an exciting adventure the family has absolutely enjoyed. One of the Heltons' favorite things about Lifestone Church has been the opportunity to closely connect with others and grow spiritually through LifeGroups. It is their desire that you, too, get connected in a LifeGroup this season and experience spiritual growth while forging life-long friendships!
